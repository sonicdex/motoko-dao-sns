# You should make a copy of this file, name it sns_init.yaml, and edit it to
# suit your needs.
#
# All principal IDs should almost certainly be changed.
#
# In this file, 1 year is nominally defined to be 365.25 days.
#
# This gets passed to `sns propose`. See propose_sns.sh.
#
# This follows the second configuration file format developed for the `sns`
# CLI. The first format will be supported for a time, but this format will
# eventually become the standard format.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# UNITS
#
# This SNS configuration file version allows specifying the various
# fields with units that make configuration easier. For instance,
# in the previous version, all fields relating to token values
# had to be specified in e8s (fractions of 10E-8 of a governance token).
# In this version, similar fields can be specified in whole tokens,
# tokens with decimals, or e8s. Below is more information on the type
# of units that can be used.
#
# For fields that represent token values (such as `transaction_fee`
# or `rejection_fee`), devs can specify decimal strings ending in
# "tokens" (plural), decimal strings ending in "token" (singular),
# or integer strings (base 10) ending in "e8s". In the case of
# "tokens" strings, the maximum number of digits after the (optional)
# decimal point is 8. The "_" character may be sprinkled throughout.
# Whitespace around number is insignificant. E.g. " 42 tokens" is
# equivalent to "42tokens".
#
# For fields that represent duration values (such as `initial_voting_period`
# or `minimum_dissolve_delay`), devs can specify durations as a concatenation
# of time spans. Where each time span is an integer number and a suffix.
# Supported suffixes:
#  - seconds, second, sec, s
#  - minutes, minute, min, m
#  - hours, hour, hr, h
#  - days, day, d
#  - weeks, week, w
#  - months, month, M -- defined as 30.44 days
#  - years, year, y -- defined as 365.25 days
#
# For example, "1w 2d 3h" gets parsed as
#
# 1 week + 2 days + 3 hours
#    =
# (1 * (7 * 24 * 60 * 60) + 2 * 24 * 60 * 60 + 3 * (60 * 60)) seconds
#
# For fields that represent percentage values (such as `bonus`), devs specify
# the value as an integer with a trailing percent sign ('%'). For example,
# `10%`.
#
# For fields that represent time of day (such as `start_time`), devs specify
# the value as a string in form "hh::mm UTC". Where hh is hour, and mm is minute.
# Only the UTC timezone is currently supported.

        2tlvc-vqaaa-aaaah-adwxa-cai (1:1 Swap dApp)

    Following a successful SNS, the following actions will be taken:
      The SNEED 1:1 Swap Canister has been forked to serve an identical purpose for $MOTOKO, included in previously provided canisters. 
      A proposal will be set forth & accepted by custodians to transfer 9992 $MOTOKO from the treasury to the $MOTOKO 1:1 Swap dApp, 
      offering existing holders the ability to convert ICRC $MOTOKO to SNS ICRC $MOTOKO - enabling decentralization of the SNS.

Proposals:
  # The cost of making an SNS proposal that is rejected by the SNS neuron
  # holders. This field is specified as a token. For example: "1 token".
  rejection_fee: 0.25 token

  # The initial voting period of an SNS proposal. A proposal's voting period
  # may be increased during its lifecycle due to the wait-for-quiet algorithm
  # (see details below). This field is specified as a duration. For example
  # "4 days".
  initial_voting_period: 4 days

  # The wait-for-quiet algorithm extends the voting period of a proposal when
  # there is a flip in the majority vote during the proposal's voting period.
  #
  # Without this, there could be an incentive to vote right at the end of a

  # half-day, etc.

  minimum_creation_stake: 0.01 tokens

# Configuration of SNS voting.
Voting:
  # The minimum dissolve delay a neuron must have to be able to cast votes on
  # proposals.
  #
  # Dissolve delay incentivizes neurons to vote in the long-term interest of
  # an SNS, as they are rewarded for longer-term commitment to that SNS.
  #
  # Users cannot access the SNS tokens used to stake neurons (until the neuron
  # is dissolved). This field is specified as a duration. For example: "6 months".
  minimum_dissolve_delay: 1 week

  # Configuration of voting power bonuses that are applied to neurons to
  # incentivize alignment with the best interest of the DAO. Note, these
  # bonuses multiply each other, so the increase in voting power due to
  # the dissolve delay bonus is used in the equation to increase voting
  # power for the age bonus.
  MaximumVotingPowerBonuses:
    # Users with a higher dissolve delay are incentivized to take the
    # long-term interests of the SNS into consideration when voting. To
    # reward this long-term commitment, this bonus can be set to a
    # percentage greater than zero, which will result in neurons having
    # their voting power increased in proportion to their dissolve delay.
    #
    # For example, if the user has a dissolve delay of 6 months, and
    # the maximum dissolve delay duration (defined below as `duration`)
    # for the dissolve delay bonus is 12 months, and the maximum bonus
    # (defined as `bonus` below) is set to 10%, then that user’s voting
    # power will be 105% of their normal voting power based on staked
    # tokens (i.e. they will have a bonus of 5%). If the user increased
    # their dissolve delay to 9 months, they would get 107.5% of the normal
    # voting power of their tokens. And if they increased to 12 months, they
    # would get 110%. If they increase further, they get no additional bonus.
    #
    # If you do not want this bonus to be applied for neurons with higher
    # dissolve delay, set `bonus` to `0%` and those neurons will not receive
    # higher voting power.
    DissolveDelay:
      # This parameter sets the maximum dissolve delay a neuron can have.
      # When reached, the maximum dissolve delay bonus will be applied.
      # This field is specified as a duration. For example: "8 years".
      duration: 1 week
      # If a neuron's dissolve delay is `duration`, its voting power will
      # be increased by the dissolve delay `bonus` amount.
      # This field is specified as a percentage. For instance,
      # a value of "100%" means that the voting power will be doubled
      # (multiplied by 2).
      bonus: 0%

    # Users with neurons staked in the non-dissolving state for a long
    # period of time are incentivized to take the long-term interests of
    # the SNS into consideration when voting. To reward this long-term
    # commitment, this bonus can be set to a percentage (greater than zero),
    # which will result in neurons having their voting power increased in
    # proportion to their age.
    #
    # For example, if the neuron has an age of 6 months, and the maximum age
    # duration (defined below as `duration`) for the age bonus is 12 months,
    # and the maximum bonus (defined as `bonus` below) is set to 10%, then
    # that neuron’s voting power will be 105% of their normal voting power
    # based on staked tokens plus dissolve delay bonus (i.e. they will have a
    # bonus of 5%). If neuron aged another 3 months to have an age of 9 months,
    # the neuron would get 107.5% of the normal voting power. And if the neuron
    # aged another 3 months to 12 months, the neuron would get 110%. If the neuron
    # ages further, it get no additional bonus.
    #
    # If this bonus should not be applied for older neurons, set the bonus
    # to `0%` and older neurons will not receive higher voting power.
    Age:
      # This parameter sets the duration of time the neuron must be staked
      # in the non-dissolving state, in other words its `age`, to reach
      # the maximum age bonus. Once this age is reached, the neuron will
      # continue to age, but no more bonus will be applied. This field
      # is specified as a duration. For example: "2 years".
      duration: 1 year
      # If a neuron's age is `duration` or older, its voting power will be
      # increased by this age`bonus` amount.
      # This field is specified as a percentage. For instance,
      # a value of "25%" means that the voting power will increase by a quarter
      # (multiplied by 1.25).
      bonus: 25%

  # Configuration of SNS voting reward parameters.
  #
  # The voting reward rate controls how quickly the supply of the SNS token
  # increases. For example, setting `initial` to `2%` will cause the supply to
  # increase by at most `2%` per year. A higher voting reward rate
  # incentivizes users to participate in governance, but also results in
  # higher inflation.
  #
  # The initial and final reward rates can be set to have a higher reward rate
  # at the launch of the SNS and a lower rate further into the SNS’s lifetime.
  # The reward rate falls quadratically from the `initial` rate to the `final`
  # rate over the course of `transition_duration`.
  #
  # Setting both `initial` and `final` to `0%` will result in the system not
  # distributing voting rewards at all.
  #
  # More details on SNS tokenomics can be found in the developer documentation:
  # https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/sns/tokenomics/rewards/#voting-rewards
  RewardRate:
    # The initial reward rate at which the SNS voting rewards will increase
    # per year. This field is specified as a percentage. For example: "15%".
    initial: 0%

    # The final reward rate at which the SNS voting rewards will increase
    # per year. This rate is reached after `transition_duration` and remains
    # at this level unless changed by an SNS proposal. This field is
    # specified as a percentage. For example: "5%".
    final: 0%

    # The voting reward rate falls quadratically from `initial` to `final`
    # over the time period defined by `transition_duration`.
    #
    # Values of 0 result in the reward rate always being `final`.
    #
    # This field is specified as a duration. For example: "8 years".
    transition_duration: 0 years

# Configuration of the initial token distribution of the SNS. You can configure
# how SNS tokens are distributed in each of the three groups:
# (1) tokens that are given to the original developers of the dapp,
# (2) treasury tokens that are owned by the SNS governance canister, and
# (3) tokens which are distributed to the decentralization swap participants.
#
# The initial token distribution must satisfy the following preconditions to be
# valid:
#    - The sum of all developer tokens in E8s must be less than `u64::MAX`.
#    - The Swap's initial balance (see group (3) above) must be greater than 0.
#    - The Swap's initial balance (see group (3) above) must be greater than or
#      equal to the sum of all developer tokens.
Distribution:
  # The initial neurons created when the SNS Governance canister is installed.
  # Each element in this list specifies one such neuron, including its stake,
  # controlling principal, memo identifying this neuron (every neuron that
  # a user has must be identified by a unique memo), dissolve delay, and a
  # vesting period. Even though these neurons are distributed at genesis,
  # they are locked in a (restricted) pre-initialization mode until the
  # decentralization swap is completed. Note that `vesting_period` starts
  # right after the SNS creation and thus includes the pre-initialization mode
  # period.
  #
  # For example:
  #  - principal: hpikg-6exdt-jn33w-ndty3-fc7jc-tl2lr-buih3-cs3y7-tftkp-sfp62-gqe
  #    stake: 1_000 tokens

  # Configuration of the vesting schedule of the neuron basket, i.e., the SNS

  VestingSchedule:
    # The number of events in the vesting schedule. This translates to how
    # many neurons will be in each participant's neuron basket. Note that
    # the first neuron in each neuron basket will have zero dissolve delay.
    # This value should thus be greater than or equal to `2`.
    events: 2

    # first neuron in the basket will be unlocked with zero dissolve delay.
    # Each other neuron in the schedule will have its dissolve delay
    # increased by `interval` compared to the previous one. For example,
    # if `events` is set to `3` and `interval` is `1 month`, then each
    # participant's neuron basket will have three neurons (with equal stake)
    # with dissolve delays zero, 1 month, and 2 months. Note that the notion
    # of `Distribution.neurons.vesting_period` applies only to developer
    # neurons. While neuron basket neurons do not use `vesting_period`, they
    # have a vesting schedule. This field is specified as a duration. For

    interval: 2 days

  # Absolute time of day when the decentralization swap is supposed to start.
  #
  # An algorithm will be applied to allow at least 24 hours between the time
  # of execution of the CreateServiceNervousSystem proposal and swap start.
  # For example, if start_time is 23:30 UTC and the proposal is adopted and
  # executed at 23:20 UTC, then the swap start will be at 23:30 UTC the next
  # day (i.e., in 24 hours and 10 min from the proposal execution time).
  #
  # WARNING: Swap start_time works differently on mainnet and in testing.
  #
  # On mainnet:
  # - Setting start_time to some value (e.g., 23:30 UTC) will allow the swap
  #   participants to be prepared for the swap in advance, e.g.,
  #   by obtaining ICPs that they would like to participate with.
  # - If start_time is not specified, the actual start time of the swap will
  #   be chosen at random (allowing at least 24 hours and less than 48 hours,
  #   as described above).
  #
  # In testing:
  # - Setting start_time to some value works the same as explained above.
  # - If start_time is not specified, the swap will begin immediately after
  #   the CreateServiceNervousSystem proposal is executed. This facilitates
  #   testing in an accelerated manner.
  #
  # start_time: 23:30 UTC  # Intentionally commented out for testing.

  # The duration of the decentralization swap. When `start_time` is calculated
  # during CreateServiceNervousSystem proposal execution, this `duration` will
  # be added to that absolute time and set as the swap's deadline.
